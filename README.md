This extension wouldn't be possible without the amazing efforts of [loft](https://loft.sh/) and their open sourced [Vcluster Docker Desktop Extension](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/loftsh/vcluster-dd-extension).  The team at loft were able to solve a necessary problem, i.e. how to access a working kubeconfig that relates to the Docker Desktop in-built Kubernetes Server.  Around this, they also built a handy control loop in React/Typescript that checks whether or not Kubernetes is running.  This extension re-uses the control loops and adds a volume share to the kubeconfig file.

Great efforts loft! ðŸš€
